Trying to create Winsock servers to transmit data between clients

### Basic Text Chat Server
This branch holds a working, but basic, textchat server. A host can launch the server program and specify what ip and port to use for the dedicated server. Users can join a server program by opening their own client programs and putting in the server's ip and port. When a user sends a message, all connected users will receive their message. Messages are not stored in any way other than in the command line window until cleared or closed.
